No streaming service show has won a series award in the history of the Emmys so this may be the year Netflix takes home the gold.
</p>
                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>Like Will is with comedies, I haven’t seen most of these dramas, except of course <i>Orange is the New Black</i> and <i>Game of Thrones</i>. <i>Game of Thrones</i> has lost its spectacularness for me, so I’m pulling for OITNB as well. Litchfield or die.

                    <h4>Who we think will win:</h4>
                    <p><span class="h5">Will: </span><i>Mad Men</i> and <i>Homeland</i> have both won this award in the past, four times and one time respectively, and <i>Breaking Bad</i>, the show that <i>Better Call Saul</i> is a spin-off of, won this award the past two years so any of those is a good bet. The best bet is probably Mad Men since this is its last award show cycle and The Academy will likely honor them.

</p>
                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>Now that Breaking Bad is out of the game, it’s pretty hard to say which show the trophy will go to. I’d place my bets on Downton Abbey just because it’s been a critic favorite for quite some time and felt like it was always second to Breaking Bad.

                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>Don Cheadle is always so great in House of Lies, but I’d like to see either Matt LeBlanc or Anthony Anderson take the trophy. LeBlanc because I just want to see him be recognized for doing something other than Joey on Friends, and Anderson because he’s spearheading a successful comedy about a black family and we need more of that on our screens. I have to add that I’m stunned Jim Parsons isn’t nominated. He’s an Emmys darling. It’s not a snub by any means. I’m just surprised The Academy didn’t just throw him a nom for the hell of it.

                    <p><span class="h5">Will: </span>Interesting to note, CBS has taken home this award the last five consecutive years. None of their comedies are nominated this year, but the award will likely go to C.K., Cheadle, Macy, or LeBlanc who were all nominated last year.


</p>
                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>I like that Will just listed four of the five nominees to say, “It will go to one of them.” I think Louis C.K. is the frontrunner here. He’s beloved by critics and fans.

                    <p><span class="h5">Will: </span>: I cannot say enough how much I love Amy Schumer, but I am obsessed with Lily Tomlin in Grace and Frankie. It only makes it THAT much sweeter that Meryl is the Grace and I am the Frankie of our friendship. For that reason, the Netflix newcomer has my vote.

</p>
                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>This is the category I’m looking forward, and at the same time, dreading most because it’s filled with some of the finest ladies in comedy, but that’s exactly why I’m so scared. I have no idea who to root for because they’re all my favorites. How is it even possible to run against Lily Tomlin? I love Grace and Frankie for the same reason Will listed above but also because Tomlin is outrageously hilarious in it. Amy Schumer is the current “it girl” and rightfully so because she’s everything I aspire to be: hilarious, purposeful, satirical, political, empowering. Then there’s Amazing Amy… Poehler. The woman ran Parks and Recreation like a boss and deserves a trophy for her last year on the show.

                    <p><span class="h5">Will: </span>Julia Louis-Dreyfus has won this award the past three years so she is always a good bet, but Amy Poehler’s Parks and Recreation has ended so she also has a very good shot at winning this.


</p>
                     <p><span class="h5">Meryl: </span>Julia Louis-Dreyfus is the one actor who I am 100 percent, totally OK with winning consistently. Her performance on Veep is side-splitting. She so deserves the award, but I would love for Schumer to win. She is so in right now with the poignant sketches in the third season of her show and her first, highly anticipated feature film Trainwreck premieres this month.
