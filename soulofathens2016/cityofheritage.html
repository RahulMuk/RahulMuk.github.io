          <p><span id="bod" class="southern">A</span>t the southern tip of the Appalachian region lies a small town, with land abundant in natural resources and a community whose roots stretch across the span of generations. A ten minute drive down the main stretch can get you from one end of the town to the next, pastures and his-torical features lining the old paved road. Homes, with foundations going back as far as the late 1800s, are still inhabited by the generations that came to be, following the settlement of their original family member. </p>
          <p>The bell of a wooden-paneled white church, located just behind where the four main stores once sat, is still heard every Sunday morning ringing through the town, just as it did on its very first day in 1910. It is the same soothing tone that residents over 80 years old can remember hearing as a child and is an encompassment of all that has been and all that is to be in years to come. Every inch of the land holds a story of its own, from its historical battles and settlement to the reason this community has stayed so connected and grounded through the years. </p>
          <p>The land, originally settled by the Creek Indians, was a desired location because of all that was found to lie within. The bright red soil, fully-enriched with minerals, the mountain sides with springs trickling down the rock, and the pure beauty of the flat land, are just a few of the main attractions. The land was and continues to be viable and a solid support for the livelihoods that have been created within its county lines.</p>
           <p>Residents say that because of this flat land, an uncommon feature for Appalachia, generations have been able to flourish and be self-sufficient. Their lives were built on this foundation and will continue to grow because of its support. With its perfect climate, abundant nature and their quiet lives, they have been able to find the balance to develop alongside this area’s strengths.</p>

         <div class="col-lg-12 caption">“A lot of people settled here because the land was opened up after the indians were taken out and it was just new territory. At that point in time, people didn’t use fertilizer or anything and so after they farmed the place for a little while, they would just move on because they would deplete the minerals from the soil. But later, when people came back or moved down, they had more knowledge on farming and found that the red clay dirt was just perfect for farming. That on top of the river in the northern part of this county and the climate is what made it possible for everyone to farm for their livelihood - cotton, corn, hay, thinks like that.”

        <p><span id="bod">A</span>lthough the land was the main attributing factor for how this area came to be, the community is why this area continues to exist and thrive today. Branching off of its one main road, lined with pastures, cotton fields and sulphur springs, you’ll find just a handful of small business — a gas station or two, the local café, maybe even a road-side fruit stand. It’s understood in this community that it’s not quantity, but quality, and they know they have the best.</p> 
        <p>The small town pride is strong and evident; one of the local restaurants is named after the local school’s mascot. Walls are adorned top to bottom and even napkin holders have the school’s baseball team on display. A trip to the grocery store is typically met with warm smiles and pauses to ask how everyone is doing. It is almost guaranteed residents will see everyone they know over the course of the weekend. </p><br><br><br>

        <p><span id="bod">C</span>ertainly, the most timeless feature of this small town is the old church and farm houses, built around the turn of the 20th century. Their walls still hold sacred the lives and moments from all who have lived within their structures. Some of these rooms have memories engraved in the minds of residents, with certain sounds and smells bringing them back to when they were young.</p>
        <p>There are houses who have been the birth place of generations, their backrooms serving as a hospital bed and as the place where a mother would rock her new born baby to sleep. They have withstood generations of families with as many as eight children, the tornado season months, the ware and tear of time. They still stand tall today because of the emotional attachment that has been built over the years, because of the appreciation this community has for its roots and its upbringing.</p>
        <p> While much else has changed, they are everlasting. </p>
