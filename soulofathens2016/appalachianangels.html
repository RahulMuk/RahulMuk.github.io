Every year, hundreds of thousands of adventurous souls flock to the Appalachian region to make their tread marks on a section of the trail. Along the way, these backpackers experience trail magic, which can be defined as random acts of kindness from past hikers or local residents deemed Trail Angels.<br><br><br>

              <p>In 2001, Mary Parry found herself living in a campground on the outskirts of Duncannon, Pa. While living in a tent, Parry encountered hikers that would set up their temporary homes in neighboring spots. This led to friendly conversations and eventually a helping hand from Parry. Finally, a hiker deemed her Trail Angel Mary, which launched her passion for trail magic, and led her to Billville, a ragtag group of men and women that identify themselves as Hiker Trash.

              <p class="pullquote northcentral">Harpers Ferry, W.Va.</p>
              <p>After completing her lifelong dream of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail in 1987, Laurie Potteiger knew she had to remain near the mountains. Starting with an entry level position at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., Potteiger eventually landed her dream job: Information Services Manager. After meeting an equally passionate thru-hiker, Dick Potteiger, they built a life together around the trail.  Dick and Laurie are enthusiastic trail maintainers who strive to give back to the Appalachian Trail and its community.

            <p>Gorczyca says the neighborhood still buzzed when he was a child. Young people found work in the mines as his father had done, or when they got out of high school a family member would help find them a offer at Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel or one of the other area factories and mills. </p>

            <p>“This is South Wheeling from 48th to 43rd street,” Gorczyca says, pointing to a hand-drawn map and chart. “At one time, in these three blocks, we had 11 bars, eight grocery stores, two drug stores, three cleaners, four barber shops, one lumber yard, two gas stations, three slaughterhouses and one bakery.” His list continues, going on to include a theater, repair shops, and more. “There were 60-something businesses in this,” gesturing to the sketched neighborhood. “Now there’s not a heck of lot left.”</p>

            <p>Gorczyca himself experienced the change in flashes. While still a young man in 1963, he accepted an offer from Wheeling’s Mail Pouch Tobacco that sent him to work as a salesman out of state. He spent nearly 40 years away, visiting once a year before he retired and moved back in 2000.  Each time he returned, the city looked less and less like the one he remembered from his childhood.</p>

            <p>Over the span of his lifetime, the collapse of the Upper Ohio Valley’s manufacturing base helped fuel an exodus of young, working-age people, resulting in the city losing approximately one half of its population, declining from 61,659 people at the 1930 census to fewer than 28,000 today. Demographers at West Virginia University’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research predict that the slide may continue into the foreseeable future. A persistent lack of viable employment opportunities and a shortage of affordable housing options caused by a regional natural gas boom pose serious challenges. </p>

            <p>In spite of this, others believe Wheeling has reached a potential turning point, with positive signs of renewal in the city for the first time in decades. Some ambitious and passionate young people have moved in during the past few years and a few Wheeling natives, like Gorczyca, have returned home. New city partnerships and grassroots organizations have formed in an attempt to rebuild Wheeling physically, economically and spiritually. It is a place marked by contrasts, with some resigned to eulogize what has been lost and others focused on what yet might be gained. There is, in a sense, a collective search for identity taking place. </p>

              <p class="northcentral pullquote">Graham County, N.C.</p>
              <p>Entering North Carolina, the narrow road of route 129 twists and winds its way deep into the Smoky Mountains, slowly making its way up a ridge only to go right back down the other side. A 40-minute drive along this road sits a 3-bedroom bed-and-breakfast with a babbling brook cutting across its 21 acres, creating a sense of isolation from nearby homes. Two dogs wrestle in the yard near blooming Bradford Pear trees while another sleeps inside, protected by the wraparound porch and wood structure of the house. The Creekside Paradise B &amps; B sits in a valley of trees with the melody of birds from all directions harmonizing with the rush of water crashing over rocks.
</p>
            <p>For 30 years, Cynthia Post, a veterinarian, and her husband Jeff Wilson, an aircraft mechanic from Canada, lived in rural Ontario. When the couple retired four years ago, they bought the cabin in Graham County, North Carolina. After moving, the couple realized they lived down the road from a trailhead on the Appalachian Trail. Feeling a responsibility to the community, Jeff and Cynthia joined the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club to help maintain the section of the trail near their home. Through their volunteer work, shuttle services, and B &amps; B; they have become trail angels to thru-hikers on the trail. </p>
        <p>Originally, Creekside Paradise was not meant to be a B &amps; B, After running into financial problems, they found a way to provide a cheap services for hikers in need, while also being available for non-hikers.</p>
        <p>“It's working out the way that the property is laid out and we’re able to supplement some of our income with it,” said Jeff. “The downturn in the price of oil has compromised our stocks and so our savings have been a little bit reduced in the last couple of years.”</p>
        <p>The couple maintain a 3.5 mile section north of Yellow Creek Gap where they cut fallen trees, define trail edges, prevent erosion, and clear trash and debris. Along with supporting the trail community, Cynthia also provides veterinary services for a local vet clinic and charitable pet rescue organization called Graham County Animal Advocates.</p>
        <p>What started as retirement in a community far from their previous home became much more through their volunteering with the hiking club and animal rescue. Those combined with running their B &amps; B gave Jeff and Cynthia a sense of community and purpose in their new home. </p>
        <p>“I didn’t really know what the Appalachian Trail was…I’m quite surprised at how many hikers there are that do the whole thing,” said Jeff, remembering his first impression of hikers.  “They’re not just taking a two week break from work, they’re taking a six month break from life. We had one fellow…. he’d done the trail three times… every once in awhile he’d take six months and go hike.” </p>
