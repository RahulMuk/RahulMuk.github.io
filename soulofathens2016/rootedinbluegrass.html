The sounds of breakneck tempos, vocal harmonies and plucked strings will soon fill the air. Behind the scenes, The Price Sisters tune fiddles, guitars and banjos. Audience members settle in with their Ale8 fueled anticipation for the band to take the stage.
</p>
          <p>Developing in the states in the early 1900s, bluegrass music has become an integral part of the Appalachian region that utilizes a unique array of string instruments. The banjo, an iconic bluegrass instrument, is designed after instruments from Africa and the fiddle originated in Ireland</p>
          <p>In its early stages, people in the Appalachian region composed songs about daily life on the farm or in the hills.  This “mountain music” increased in popularity across the nation with the birth of audio recordings in the 1900s.  The father of bluegrass, Bill Monroe, stepped onto the scene in 1939 and the genre was later given its name in reference to his band, “The Blue Grass Boys.”</p>

        <p> They picked up their first instruments around the age of nine and quickly began performing at local events. Now, ten years later, Lauren and Leanna continue to perform. Not only are they pursuing degrees in music with a concentration in traditional and bluegrass they also recently signed a record deal.</p>
        <p>“We’ve grown up playing [bluegrass] on the porch at home in the summer when all the family would get together. It makes me think of our family. It makes me feel at home,” Lauren said.  These sentiments resonate with members of the audience as they relate the feeling to their lives.</p>
        <p>Just as Appalachia covers a vast area of land, people’s memories of bluegrass tend to have a large span. “Whether we play or just listen it’s always been something that brings us together.  This whole Appalachian area you find this music in the pockets and hollows. It’s all the same and just makes me think of home wherever I go,” Leanna said.</p><br>

<p>In 1947, a Joe Hardwick could be found in his childhood home in Louisa, KY, listening to Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys on the Grand Ole Opry. With popcorn balls and fudge to snack on, neighbors, aunts and uncles huddled around the battery-operated radio until the musicians in Nashville sign off around 2 a.m. </p>

				
				


<p>“I knew when I was growing up, I always wanted to play an instrument, but I was so poor, I couldn’t buy one,” Hardwick, now 73, said.</p>
<p>In the past 50 years, he has lived in numerous places in the eastern United States, ranging from Ohio to Florida. During his later years, Hardwick decided to retire in his hometown of Louisa and open a banjo shop. </p>
<p>Hardwick builds and repairs instruments for local musicians. When an accident forced him into retirement in 1997, he thought it would be a good time to start constructing banjos.</p>
<p>“I needed something to do so I built one banjo in the basement in the house where I lived,” Hardwick said. </p>
<p>Since then, he has created more than 100 handmade banjos and repaired even more. When he first began, it would take him up to three months to complete just one instrument. Now a seasoned craftsman, Hardwick can bring an instrument from start to finish in three short weeks. </p>

        <p>Further north sits a small shop off of Route 33 in Nelsonville, OH.  Over sounds of tools clanking, strings twanging and quiet radio noises, Nick Collura and his employee chat idly as they repair instruments for local musicians.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Collura has set up the Insea Sound Shop to repair instruments and record music. Though not originally trained in bluegrass, he finds himself largely surrounded by the genre. Collura mostly repairs banjos and has since become enamored with their sound.</p> 
        <p>“[I was] just drawn to the soul of it. It seemed real. It seemed working class,” said Collura on bluegrass music as a whole.</p><br>
        <p>Working in this region for twenty some years has brought him in contact with a wide variety of people and he likes to think he can relate to just about all of them.</p>
        <p>When Mike Coe came into his shop to buy a new set of strings for his blues guitar, Collura offered him a job on the spot. Since then, Coe has learned how to repair a wide range of instruments under the watchful eye of Collura.</p>
        <p>“Almost everybody around here likes bluegrass music because it reminds you of back home and being in the country and having a good time and just enjoying life; enjoying nature and everything like that,” Coe said.</p>
        <p>After living in the region for some time, he says he has also picked up an appreciation for bluegrass.  To him it is a music that brings people together as a community —even just for an hour long live concert, they are neighbors.</p>
