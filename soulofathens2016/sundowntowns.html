          <!--<p class="quote">“When they came here they arrived in Wheeling at night,” Ed Gorczyca says of his parents’ journey to the city. This was the story told to him. His mother awoke in the morning and looked out the window of the room where they were staying and in Polish said, ‘gora tam I gora tutaj,’ meaning a mountain on that side and a mountain on this side. “Because where she came from, they didn’t have hills like we got here.”</p>-->
            
            <p><span id="bod" class="northcentral">T</span>he signs have been taken down, many of the town residents’ opinions changed, yet, Waverly, a town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and its neighboring community of East Jackson are still reeling from the ghosts of its past it has yet to shake.  The Appalachian region, while a safe haven for many, has not been exempt from the racial discrimination that has haunted America since its inception. One glaring example of this is the existence of sundown towns within the region, a town that is all white, on purpose. Although the signs that said “Nigger don’t let the sun go down on you in (insert town name)” have been removed, and ordinances barring blacks from residing within city limits have been eradicated many of these towns still remain almost completely white.</p>
            <p>East Jackson, or “E.J.”, as it’s often referred to, is a community of black, white, and mixed individuals, that you won’t find on any map. And without knowing of its whereabouts, a place that you could pass through in a blink of an eye.  The people that call East Jackson home have been raised in the shadows of a sundown town, and the lingering legacy of a town founded in discriminatory practices. These residents have faced outright racism and more institutionalized forms of discrimination.  While there is still friction with the neighboring town of Waverly, the people that live in this small community have created an environment of support and camaraderie for one another. </p><br><br><br>

            <p>The memories of John Jackson’s childhood reflect on the simplicity of life in E.J. “We swam in the creeks, cut grape vines to swing on in the woods, and fished,” Jackson recalled. The same land he used for recreation as a child, holds close ties to his ancestors, many of whom worked the land in the 1800s. His family moved to the area from Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, calling the patch of land he remains on to this day home. The policies of neighboring Waverly limited the choices for their work and living, which often go hand in hand. “Black people couldn’t live in Waverly anyway, but they had to work you know… cutting timber, farming, and sharecropping,” said Jackson. </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">
            <p>Born in the holler behind his current house, Jackson knows every inch of the hilly terrain and winding roads from E.J. to Waverly. </p>
            <p>Having gone to school in Waverly, still commonplace for most of the children living in East Jackson, John frequently heard degrading remarks about his race. “Whenever there’s a bunch of white people, you gonna hear the ‘N’. You can bet on that if there’s a bunch of ‘em,” said Jackson. </p>
            <p>However, in Waverly and the surrounding area, some forms of discrimination have recently taken a less visual form. A history of nepotism and reported prejudicial hiring practices at plants near Waverly have pushed qualified residents out. “If you want jobs you gonna have to move. For one thing there’s no jobs here, and the jobs here, like at the plant down there in Piketon, most of those people hired in here in the 50s…now their grandkids are working there,” said Jackson. </p>

            <p>These policies of nepotism succeed in keeping outsiders like Jackson’s two sons, who he considered extremely qualified for positions, out of work and force them to move elsewhere. A couple years ago, Jackson recalls that no black got so much as an interview. “They didn’t even look at their applications,” John said. </p>
            <p>Despite the way Jackson and the E.J. community have been treated as a whole, he cites the small increase of black families moving into Waverly as a sign of hope. The sentiment he and his wife adhere to is that, if you don’t make any waves, there won’t be any problems, saying “If I didn’t love living in the country, I’d go to Waverly to live and wouldn’t have a bit of problem.” </p>
            <p>While Jackson is confident in the progress of many of the towns residents some of the youth of E.J. aren’t as optimistic. Their own experiences with racism seems to center around Waverly. </p><br><br><br>

            <p>The history of Waverly being a unhospitable place for minorities is not only in the pages of history. Darius Rider, 17, of East Jackson knows the first hand stigma that students living in East Jackson are at times given. “I’ve never really fought anyone without a reason. Like I’ve been called something like a nigger to fight,” Darius said. Many relatives have had the same problems and had to fight to try ward off any further incidents. </p>
            <p>“If I’m in Waverly I have to at least be with someone because there’s so many people that don’t like me… because I’m black and because where I’m from” Rider said. </p>
            <p>While many of the youth that call EJ home relish in the nature that surrounds them, many have hopes of leaving. “It’s basically a ghetto,” Tyrell Chenoweth, 17, of East Jackson said, “In my future I wouldn’t really want my kids to grow up in the ghetto.” </p>
            <p>These instances have only further galvanized the you and the community as a whole, “If someone messes with one of ‘em, they mess with EJ in general” Chenoweth said. </p>
