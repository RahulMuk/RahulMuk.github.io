                                    <p class="subhead">DJ and Lyle Fuller began adopting in 2007. Little did they know over time they would open their home to seven children who grew up in harsh family environments and the inexhaustible foster system. As a child of adoption herself, DJ creates a home where her children feel safe to talk openly about their past issues of abuse and neglect. Through teaching her children Trauma Release Exercise, or TRE, a series of exercises to help the body deal with past or present stressors, both DJ and her family come closer to accepting their pasts as a part of who they are.</p>
