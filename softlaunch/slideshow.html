        <p class="body">Renowned as “The Last Company Owned Town in Ohio”, the community of Haydenville remains steeped in history not only through the rows of company houses that are still occupied, but also through the residents that perpetuate the legacy of the community as it once was.</p>
        <p class="body">Located in the Hocking Valley of Southeast Ohio, Haydenville was founded in 1852 by Columbus industrialist Peter Hayden as a place where workers and their families could live, work, play and worship together as a community. While the town’s physical appearance has not changed much over the years, that social foundation has shifted into a more quiet and guarded dynamic, with current residents often not socializing beyond their sections of town. Yet, within these self-constructed social groups, the community members have made Haydenville home. </p>
